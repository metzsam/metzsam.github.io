## Sam Metz, Associated Press

Hi! I'm Sam Metz and I'm a reporter for the Associated Press, covering Utah, Nevada and points beyond. I mainly write about western politics and the Colorado River but also often report on public lands, wildfires, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and more.

I'm based in Salt Lake City after spending two years as AP's one-man bureau in Carson City, Nevada. Before coming to the AP, I was a political reporter at The Desert Sun in Palm Springs, California, where I wrote on politics for California papers within the USA TODAY Network. I'm a graduate of UC Berkeley and spent two years writing on migration in the Mediterranean as a Fulbright Scholar and freelancer based in Tangier, Morocco.
